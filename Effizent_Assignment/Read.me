This  project incorporates the Django framework and Python for backend development, MySQL as the database, and a simple user interface built using HTML and CSS. 
The project includes models, forms, and views, and i've created templates such as confirmation.html and form.html for rendering the form and confirmation email. 
i've secured sensitive information by removing my email and password from settings.py and views.py. For running the project, 
it requires the Django extension and a local Python interpreter. You can start the development server with the command python manage.py runserver, and the application will run locally on localhost:8000.
If deploying to a production environment, ensure to configure the database and email settings accordingly for security and efficiency.Install Django if not already installed:
